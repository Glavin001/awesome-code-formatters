# Contribution Guidelines

If you want to contribute to this list (please do), send me a pull request or contact me [@rishirdua](https://www.twitter.com/rishirdua)

Unfortunately, not every tool/library can be considered. The aim of the list is to provide a concise list of noteworthy modern software. This means that suggested software is either

(a) widely recommended and used regardless of your personal opinion

(b) highly discussed in the community due to its innovative nature

(b) absolutely unique in its approach and function

Self-promotion is frowned upon and will be reviewed critically but the suggestion will of course be approved if the criteria match.

Furthermore, please ensure your pull request follows the following guidlines:

* Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Please make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Use the following format for libraries: \[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.
* Entries should be sorted in ascending alphabetical order, i.e. a to z.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorisation are welcome.
* Keep descriptions short, simple and unbiased.
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
